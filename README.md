# Terraform Examples for Cloud and On-Premise (VMware) Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This repository contains a collection of Terraform examples demonstrating how to use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) across various cloud providers and on-premise environments (specifically VMware). These examples are designed to help you get started with Terraform and provide reusable templates for common infrastructure scenarios.

## Introduction

Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code, allowing you to define, provision, and manage resources across multiple Cloud Providers and On-Premise(VMware) environments. Whether you're managing cloud resources or virtualized infrastructure on-premise, these examples will help you get started with Terraform.

## Prerequisites

Before using the examples in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Terraform**: [Download and install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- **Terraform Providers**:
  - Cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - VMware vSphere provider
- **Required Tools**:
  - Git
  - CLI tools for your cloud provider (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI)
  - VMware vSphere access (for on-premise examples)

## Cloud Examples

The `cloud/` directory contains examples for deploying infrastructure on popular cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each subdirectory includes a Terraform configuration for a specific use case.

### AWS
- **EC2 Instance**: Deploy a simple EC2 instance.
- **S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket with basic configuration.
- **VPC**: Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets and security groups.

### Azure
- **Virtual Machine**: Deploy a virtual machine in Azure.
- **Storage Account**: Create a storage account with a container.
- **Virtual Network**: Set up a virtual network with subnets.

## On-Premise (VMware) Examples

The `onpremise/` directory focuses on VMware vSphere, providing examples for managing on-premise infrastructure using Terraform.

### VMware vSphere
- **VM Deployment**: Deploy a virtual machine in a vSphere environment.
- **Network Configuration**: Configure virtual networks and port groups.
- **Datastore Management**: Manage datastores and storage resources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-examples.git
   cd terraform-examples
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired example directory:
   ```bash
   cd cloud/aws/ec2-instance
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Review the Terraform plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Destroy the infrastructure (when no longer needed):
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
